        "explanation": "This is a developmental right that aims to mainstream historically marginalized settlements inside forests. By converting them into revenue villages, it gives them legal recognition, enables the provision of government services like schools and healthcare, and integrates them into the formal governance structure."

        "explanation": "This is the basis for Community Forest Resource (CFR) rights. It is a powerful governance right that legally empowers the Gram Sabha to act as the custodian of its traditional forests, make management rules, and stop destructive activities, thereby fostering community-led conservation."

It ensures that any legitimate customary right that might not have been explicitly listed in the previous clauses (like rights to sacred groves, pathways, or specific clays/stones) can still be recognized. It makes the list of rights inclusive while explicitly prohibiting the right to hunting."

        "implication": "This means that the process of converting forest land into private holdings for FRA beneficiaries does not require separate clearance under the Forest (Conservation) Act. It clarifies that recognizing a pre-existing right is not a 'diversion' of forest land in the legal sense, thereby streamlining the process of granting titles."

        "explanation": "In many areas, people had been given temporary or insecure forms of land tenure ('pattas' or leases) by governments in the past.
